 ##DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. 
You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow. 

The first thing you should do is detail your goals for the script (what you want it to achieve): 
Customers can have a name added to a plaque; each letter costs $5. When a user enters a name, show them how much it will cost. 
Next, break it into a series of tasks that have to be performed in order to achieve the goals: 
1. The script is triggered when the button is clicked. 2. It collects the name entered into the form field. 3. It checks that the user has entered a value. 

 what is the STRING OPERATOR ?
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
