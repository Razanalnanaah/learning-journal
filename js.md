who do i write a script?
It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created. 

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon.
STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND
EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE
A statement is an individual instruction that the
computer should follow. Each one should start on a
new line and end with a semicolon. This makes your
code easier to read and follow.
The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter
when a step is over, indicating that it should move
to the next step.
