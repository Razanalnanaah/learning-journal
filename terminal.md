# The Command Line!

Opening a terminal is fairly easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different but here are a few places to start looking.

If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .

Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX. This tutorial won't focus on these as I reckon you can probably figure that part out by yourself. This tutorial will focus instead on the command line (also known as a terminal) running Bash.

The command line is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before, can be a bit daunting. Don't worry, with a bit of practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend. Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind so much as adding to it. While you can leave the GUI alltogether, most people open up a command line interface just as another window on their desktop (in fact you can have as many open as you like). This is also to our advantage as we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time. We can also easily jump back to the GUI when it suits us. Experiment until you find the setup that suits you best. As an example I will typically have 3 terminals open: 1 in which I do my working, another to bring up ancilliary data and a final one for viewing Manual pages (more on these later).
