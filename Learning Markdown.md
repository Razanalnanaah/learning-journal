# How To learning Markdown

 We'll start by learning two basic elements in text formatting: italics and bold. In these lessons, you'll notice some formatted red text; this text is actually written in Markdown! Regular Markdown doesn't look any different than regular text, but we're providing some highlighting to make it easier to see.

To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.

For this next lesson, make the word "not" italic.

Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really** get your point across.

In the box below, make the word "will" bold.
