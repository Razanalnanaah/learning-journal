For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

On the right you can see a
layout that is quite common
(particularly on blog sites).
At the top of the page is the
header, containing a logo and the
primary navigation.
Under this are one or more
articles or posts. Sometimes
these are summaries that link to
individual posts.
There is a side bar on the righthand side (perhaps featuring
a search option, links to other
recent articles, other sections of
the site, or even ads).
When coding a site like this,
developers would usually put
these main sections of the page
inside <div> elements and use
the class or id attributes to
indicate the purpose of that part
of the page
