CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files


The rule for the 
element sets a default color for all the text as well as the default background color for the page. Both use color names.
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box. You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names (covered on the next page).
